Hi there, 

I am a second year PhD student majoring biosystems engineering in Oklahoma State University. I am a Chinese who brought my wife and kid to the United States in 2014. In March 2016, our second baby was born in Stillwater, Oklahoma. Life became very tough but is still full with happiness.
